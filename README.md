# Email_Spam_Detection
ðŸš€ Email Spam Detection using NLP and Machine Learning models (NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) with 98% accuracy and optimized via hyperparameter tuning.
# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

A machine learning project that detects spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF and classifiers such as NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Achieved 98% accuracy and suggested the best performing model through evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Optional: create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS

# Install required packages
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
Add the spam.csv file to test the data.
Finally run all cells and you can get the best model.
